# skip-cipher

Hello, this project is used as a fun way for me to learn python and to think about how encryption and decryption work. I would NOT use this program to protect your data. Skip-cipher will also allow me to learn more about using git and github in a linux environment.

I first wrote this program as an assignment for an Intro to Programming class.
